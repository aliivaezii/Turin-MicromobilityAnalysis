\begin{abstract}
Shared electric scooters have emerged as a significant component of urban mobility, yet their operational dynamics, public transport integration, and financial sustainability remain poorly characterised. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of e-scooter operations in Turin, Italy, examining $N = 2{,}548{,}650$ validated trips from three licensed operators (LIME, VOI, BIRD) over a 23-month period (January 2024--November 2025)---one of the largest micromobility datasets analysed in the European context. We introduce three methodological innovations. \textit{First}, vectorised buffer analysis using GTFS stop geometries classifies 2.5 million trip endpoints at multiple proximity thresholds, yielding an Integration Index of 86.6\% and Feeder Percentage of 63.9\% at 100 metres---providing robust evidence that e-scooters function as first-mile/last-mile feeders rather than transit competitors. \textit{Second}, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, adapted from biomedical research, quantifies fleet turnover dynamics, revealing significant inter-operator heterogeneity (median survival: LIME 3.5h, VOI 10.5h) and decreasing hazard rates ($k < 1$) that identify ``ghost vehicles'' requiring rebalancing intervention. \textit{Third}, Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 iterations characterises economic risk, demonstrating that Turin's e-scooter market achieves a 54.5\% net profit margin with only 0.52\% probability of annual loss---rendering municipal subsidies unnecessary for financial viability. These findings inform actionable recommendations: operators should implement 5-day idle thresholds for fleet rebalancing; municipalities should maintain fleet caps while transitioning to demand-responsive deployment. The integrated framework provides a replicable template for evidence-based micromobility policy.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

% --- Paragraph 1: Broad Context (The Transition) ---
The integration of shared electric scooters (e-scooters) into urban transport networks represents one of the most significant transformations in urban mobility of the past decade. Since the initial deployments in the United States circa 2017, shared micromobility has evolved from a disruptive novelty---characterised by unregulated fleet expansion and municipal backlash---to a formalised component of regulated transport infrastructure across European cities \citep{shaheen2020sharing}. This transition is exemplified by the European Union's Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy, which positions shared micromobility as a critical enabler of first-mile and last-mile connectivity, complementing legacy public transport systems \citep{fishman2016bikeshare}. By 2024, major European cities including Paris, Rome, and Berlin had implemented comprehensive permit regimes, fleet caps, and designated parking zones, signalling the maturation of the sector from experimental pilot to permanent urban infrastructure.

% --- Paragraph 2: The Problem (The Black Box of Operations) ---
Despite this regulatory formalisation, a fundamental knowledge gap persists: municipal authorities regulate fleet sizes and service boundaries, yet they lack granular understanding of the \textit{operational dynamics} that determine system efficiency. This ``black box'' of e-scooter operations encompasses three interrelated dimensions that remain poorly characterised. First, \textit{fleet survival}---the duration for which vehicles remain idle between rentals---directly influences asset utilisation and rebalancing costs, yet is rarely quantified beyond aggregate turnover metrics. Second, \textit{multimodal integration}---the spatial relationship between e-scooter trip endpoints and public transport nodes---determines whether shared scooters function as complementary feeders or competitive substitutes. Third, \textit{unit economics}---the per-trip profitability across heterogeneous urban zones---governs long-term service viability and the risk of market exits. The interplay between these three dimensions is insufficiently understood, limiting the capacity of urban planners to design evidence-based policies that optimise system performance.

% --- Paragraph 3: The Gap (Siloed Studies) ---
The existing literature has addressed individual facets of micromobility performance, yet studies remain methodologically siloed. Research on temporal demand patterns \citep{reck2021explaining} has characterised hourly and weekly usage cycles but has not linked these patterns to spatial integration with transit. Safety-focused analyses \citep{trivedi2020injuries} have documented injury incidence but provide limited insight into operational efficiency. Economic evaluations of early market failures have examined aggregate profitability \citep{fishman2016bikeshare} without decomposing spatial heterogeneity at the zone level. Critically, no prior study has simultaneously modelled the \textit{spatial}, \textit{temporal}, and \textit{financial} dimensions of a multi-operator e-scooter system within a unified analytical framework. This methodological fragmentation prevents the synthesis of insights required for integrated transport planning.

% --- Paragraph 4: Our Contribution (Turin Study + 3 Innovations) ---
This paper addresses these limitations through a comprehensive empirical analysis of shared e-scooter operations in Turin, Italy. The study examines $N = 2{,}548{,}650$ validated trips collected from three licensed operators (LIME, VOI, and BIRD) over a 23-month period (January 2024 to November 2025), representing one of the largest and most temporally extensive micromobility datasets analysed in the European context. Our methodological contribution is threefold. First, we introduce \textit{vectorised buffer analysis} for public transport integration, leveraging GTFS stop geometries to classify trip endpoints at multiple proximity thresholds (50m, 100m, 200m) and quantify first-mile/last-mile connectivity (see Figure~\ref{fig:integration_map}). Second, we repurpose \textit{Kaplan-Meier survival analysis} \citep{kaplan1958nonparametric}---traditionally employed in biomedical research---to model fleet turnover dynamics and identify ``ghost vehicles'' exhibiting prolonged idle durations (see Figure~\ref{fig:survival_curves}). Third, we apply \textit{stochastic economic modelling} via Monte Carlo simulation to assess profitability risk under parametric uncertainty, yielding probability-of-loss estimates at the operator and zone level (see Figure~\ref{fig:monte_carlo}). Together, these innovations provide a replicable framework for evaluating the operational, spatial, and financial performance of shared micromobility systems.

The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section~\ref{sec:related_work} synthesises the relevant literature on micromobility usage, policy, and methodological approaches. Section~\ref{sec:study_area} describes the study context and data sources. Section~\ref{sec:methodology} presents the analytical framework across five research exercises. Section~\ref{sec:results} reports the empirical findings. Section~\ref{sec:discussion} discusses policy implications, and Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes.

% SECTION 2: RELATED WORK
% =============================================================================

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}

The academic literature on shared micromobility has expanded substantially since the emergence of dockless e-scooter systems in the late 2010s. This section synthesises prior research across three thematic domains---usage patterns, policy and integration, and methodological innovation---positioning the contributions of the present study within the evolving state of knowledge.

% --- Subsection 2.1: Usage Patterns and Demand Modelling ---
\subsection{Usage Patterns and Demand Modelling}
\label{subsec:usage_patterns}

Early investigations into shared micromobility focused on characterising temporal and spatial demand patterns. \citet{fishman2016bikeshare} provided a foundational review of bikeshare systems, identifying pronounced morning and evening peaks consistent with commute-oriented usage. Subsequent research extended these findings to dockless e-scooters, documenting unimodal evening peak demand in North American cities \citep{shaheen2020sharing}. \citet{reck2021explaining} conducted a particularly influential analysis of shared micromobility in Zurich, Switzerland, employing discrete choice models to explain mode substitution and competition effects. Their study demonstrated that e-scooter demand exhibits significant spatial heterogeneity, with trip generation concentrated in high-density commercial and transit-adjacent zones.

The present study extends this body of work by applying \textit{gravity model calibration} to quantify the distance-decay relationship governing e-scooter flows in Turin. While Reck et al.\ focused on mode choice probabilities, our origin-destination analysis estimates the decay parameter $\beta$ (see Equation~\ref{eq:gravity_model}) and computes flow concentration metrics including the Gini coefficient ($G = 0.774$) and Shannon entropy ($H = 0.858$). These metrics reveal a Pareto-like distribution of demand, wherein the top 10 OD corridors account for 3.75\% of system-wide flows (see Figure~\ref{fig:od_heatmap}). Furthermore, we disaggregate temporal patterns by operator, identifying statistically significant differences in peak hour concentration via the Kruskal-Wallis H-test ($H = 95{,}913$, $p < 0.001$; see Table~\ref{tab:kruskal_wallis}).

% --- Subsection 2.2: Policy Frameworks and Public Transport Integration ---
\subsection{Policy Frameworks and Public Transport Integration}
\label{subsec:policy_integration}

A parallel strand of literature has examined the policy frameworks governing shared micromobility and their implications for multimodal integration. \citet{shaheen2020sharing} proposed a comprehensive policy toolkit encompassing fleet caps, parking regulations, data-sharing mandates, and equity requirements. Their framework has been adopted by numerous European municipalities, including Turin, which implemented a 3,000-vehicle cap distributed across three licensed operators in 2022. However, the toolkit articulates \textit{what} cities should regulate without providing quantitative methods to assess \textit{whether} these policies achieve their integration objectives.

Empirical studies of multimodal integration have typically employed buffer-based proximity analysis, wherein e-scooter trips are classified as ``integrated'' if their origin or destination falls within a defined catchment distance of a public transport stop \citep{reck2021explaining}. However, prior implementations have relied on simplified point-to-point distance calculations, neglecting the geometric complexity of transit network coverage. The present study advances this methodology through \textit{vectorised GTFS buffering}, in which stop geometries from Turin's General Transit Feed Specification are transformed into spatial polygons at multiple thresholds (50m, 100m, 200m). This approach enables efficient classification of 2.5 million trip endpoints via spatial indexing (STRtree), yielding an Integration Index of 86.6\% and a Feeder Percentage of 63.9\% at the 100-metre threshold (see Figure~\ref{fig:buffer_sensitivity}). These findings provide robust empirical evidence for the first-mile/last-mile hypothesis, demonstrating that the majority of e-scooter trips originate or terminate within walking distance of transit stops.

Beyond spatial proximity, we quantify route efficiency through the \textit{tortuosity index}, defined as the ratio of actual travel distance to Euclidean distance ($\tau = D_{\text{actual}} / D_{\text{euclidean}}$). A system-wide average tortuosity of $\bar{\tau} = 1.31$ indicates that e-scooter routes are approximately 31\% longer than straight-line paths, consistent with functional navigation rather than recreational exploration.

% --- Subsection 2.3: Methodological Innovation and Cross-Disciplinary Approaches ---
\subsection{Methodological Innovation and Cross-Disciplinary Approaches}
\label{subsec:methodological_innovation}

The analytical methods employed in micromobility research have largely been drawn from traditional transport modelling, including regression analysis, spatial autocorrelation measures, and discrete choice frameworks \citep{ortuzar2011modelling}. However, the unique characteristics of shared mobility---particularly the dockless, on-demand nature of e-scooters---invite methodological borrowing from adjacent disciplines.

The present study introduces two cross-disciplinary innovations. First, we adapt \textit{Kaplan-Meier survival analysis} \citep{kaplan1958nonparametric}, a non-parametric estimator originally developed for biomedical applications, to model fleet turnover dynamics. In this formulation, the ``survival'' of a parked vehicle refers to its probability of remaining unrented at time $t$ after being parked. The survival function $\hat{S}(t) = \prod_{t_i \leq t} (1 - d_i / n_i)$ is estimated for each operator, revealing significant inter-operator heterogeneity in median survival times: LIME ($\tilde{t} = 3.5$ hours), BIRD ($\tilde{t} = 6.0$ hours), and VOI ($\tilde{t} = 10.5$ hours). Parametric fitting with the Weibull distribution yields shape parameters $k < 1$ for all operators, indicating decreasing hazard rates---vehicles parked for extended periods become progressively less likely to be rented, suggesting spatial clustering in low-demand locations. Log-rank tests confirm statistically significant differences between all operator pairs ($\chi^2 > 3.4 \times 10^8$, $p < 0.001$; see Figure~\ref{fig:weibull_survival}). This methodological extension provides a novel lens for identifying ``ghost vehicles''---scooters exceeding a 120-hour idle threshold---which require operational intervention.

Second, we apply \textit{Monte Carlo simulation} to quantify economic risk under stochastic input variation. Revenue and variable cost parameters are sampled from uniform distributions ($\pm 15\%$ and $\pm 10\%$, respectively), while trip volumes are modelled as normally distributed with a 5\% coefficient of variation. Over 10,000 iterations, the simulation yields a probability of annual loss of 0.52\%, with a 5\% Value-at-Risk of €1.21 million (see Figure~\ref{fig:tornado_sensitivity}). This approach extends deterministic profitability assessments by explicitly modelling tail-risk scenarios, providing decision-relevant insights for operators and regulators.

% --- Subsection 2.4: Synthesis and Research Gap ---
\subsection{Synthesis and Research Gap}
\label{subsec:synthesis}

The literature reviewed above reveals a fragmented landscape in which temporal demand, spatial integration, and economic viability are analysed in isolation. \citet{reck2021explaining} modelled usage and mode choice but did not examine fleet survival or unit economics. \citet{shaheen2020sharing} defined policy instruments without quantifying their effectiveness. Studies employing survival analysis in transport contexts have focused on vehicle ownership duration or infrastructure lifecycle, not on intra-day fleet turnover.

The present study addresses this gap by developing an integrated analytical framework that simultaneously examines:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item \textit{Temporal demand} via non-parametric statistical testing (Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney);
    \item \textit{Spatial flow} via origin-destination matrices with gravity model calibration;
    \item \textit{Multimodal integration} via vectorised GTFS buffer analysis;
    \item \textit{Fleet survival} via Kaplan-Meier and Weibull modelling;
    \item \textit{Economic viability} via Monte Carlo simulation with scenario analysis.
\end{enumerate}

This comprehensive approach, applied to one of the largest European micromobility datasets ($N = 2.5$ million trips, 23 months, three operators), provides a replicable template for evidence-based urban transport policy.

\section{Methodological Framework}
\label{sec:methodology}

This section formalises the analytical framework underpinning the empirical analysis. The methodology integrates three complementary pillars: \textit{spatiotemporal pattern recognition} for demand characterisation, \textit{multimodal integration assessment} for first-mile/last-mile quantification, and \textit{fleet dynamics with microeconomic modelling} for operational viability evaluation. Each pillar combines established transport engineering techniques with cross-disciplinary methodological innovations.


% =============================================================================
% 3.1 SPATIOTEMPORAL PATTERN RECOGNITION
% =============================================================================

\subsection{Spatiotemporal Pattern Recognition: The Physics of Flow}
\label{subsec:spatiotemporal}

The first analytical pillar characterises the fundamental ``physics'' of e-scooter demand: where trips originate, where they terminate, and how flow intensity decays with distance.

\subsubsection{Origin-Destination Matrix Construction}
\label{subsubsec:od_construction}

The spatial structure of demand is encoded in an \textbf{Origin-Destination (O-D) matrix} $\mathbf{T} \in \mathbb{R}^{89 \times 89}$, where entry $T_{ij}$ represents the number of trips originating in statistical zone $i$ and terminating in zone $j$. Matrix construction proceeds through a three-stage pipeline:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item \textbf{Coordinate Validation:} Raw GPS coordinates $(lat, lon)$ are validated against the Turin bounding box ($44.97\degree$N--$45.14\degree$N, $7.57\degree$E--$7.77\degree$E) and transformed from WGS84 (EPSG:4326) to UTM Zone 32N (EPSG:32632).
    
    \item \textbf{Spatial Join:} Trip endpoints are assigned to zones via point-in-polygon queries against the 89 \textit{Zone Statistiche} polygons, leveraging R-tree spatial indexing for $O(\log n)$ query complexity.
    
    \item \textbf{Aggregation:} Zone-to-zone flows are aggregated across the 23-month observation period, yielding a matrix with 6,613 non-zero entries (82.6\% density).
\end{enumerate}

To quantify flow concentration, we compute the \textbf{Gini coefficient} $G = 0.774$, indicating highly unequal demand distribution, and \textbf{Shannon entropy} $H = 0.858$, reflecting moderate destination diversity. The \textbf{flow asymmetry index} $A = 0.231$ captures directional imbalance between zone pairs.

\subsubsection{Gravity Model Calibration}
\label{subsubsec:gravity}

The distance-decay relationship governing inter-zonal flows is quantified using a \textbf{doubly-constrained gravity model}, the canonical framework for aggregate trip distribution in transportation science \citep{ortuzar2011modelling}:

\begin{equation}
    T_{ij} = K \cdot P_i \cdot A_j \cdot e^{-\beta \cdot d_{ij}}
    \label{eq:gravity}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $T_{ij}$ is the estimated flow from zone $i$ to zone $j$; $P_i$ is the \textit{production} (total trips originating) at zone $i$; $A_j$ is the \textit{attraction} (total trips terminating) at zone $j$; $d_{ij}$ is the Euclidean distance between zone centroids (in kilometres); $\beta$ is the \textit{distance decay parameter}, governing how rapidly trip probability declines with distance; and $K$ is a balancing constant ensuring conservation of row and column totals.

The exponential decay specification reflects the short-range nature of micromobility: users are willing to travel greater distances for high-value destinations, but this willingness diminishes exponentially. Maximum likelihood estimation yields $\hat{\beta} = 1.50$ (95\% CI: [1.42, 1.58]) with model fit $R^2 = 0.72$, indicating that distance and zonal activity explain approximately 72\% of observed flow variance.

This methodology generates the flow patterns visualised in Figure~\ref{fig:flow_map_professional}.


% =============================================================================
% 3.2 MULTIMODAL INTEGRATION ASSESSMENT
% =============================================================================

\subsection{Multimodal Integration Assessment: The First-Mile Problem}
\label{subsec:integration}

The second analytical pillar addresses a fundamental question in sustainable mobility: do shared e-scooters \textit{compete} with public transport or \textit{complement} it by solving the first-mile/last-mile (FMLM) access problem?

\subsubsection{The First-Mile/Last-Mile Hypothesis}
\label{subsubsec:fmlm_hypothesis}

Fixed-route public transport systems suffer from an inherent spatial constraint: catchment areas are typically limited to 400--800 metres walking distance from stops \citep{shaheen2020sharing}. Travellers beyond this radius face a ``first-mile'' problem (accessing the transit stop from their origin) and a ``last-mile'' problem (reaching their destination from the egress stop). If e-scooter trips systematically originate or terminate near transit stops, this constitutes evidence for a \textit{complementary} rather than \textit{competitive} relationship.

\subsubsection{Vectorised Buffer Analysis}
\label{subsubsec:buffer_analysis}

We operationalise the FMLM hypothesis through \textbf{vectorised buffer analysis}, a computationally efficient spatial overlay technique. Public transport stop locations are extracted from Turin's General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data, comprising $N_{PT} = 1{,}583$ unique stops across metro, tram, and bus networks.

For each buffer threshold $d \in \{50, 100, 200\}$ metres, the classification logic is:

\begin{equation}
    \text{Integrated}_{i} = 
    \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{if } \min_{s \in S_{PT}} \| \mathbf{o}_i - \mathbf{p}_s \| < d \;\lor\; \min_{s \in S_{PT}} \| \mathbf{d}_i - \mathbf{p}_s \| < d \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:integration_logic}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\mathbf{o}_i$ is the origin coordinate of trip $i$; $\mathbf{d}_i$ is the destination coordinate of trip $i$; $\mathbf{p}_s$ is the coordinate of PT stop $s$; and $S_{PT}$ is the set of all public transport stops. The disjunction ($\lor$) captures trips where \textit{either} endpoint connects to transit.

Implementation leverages R-tree spatial indexing (STRtree) for $O(\log n)$ nearest-neighbour queries across 2.5 million trip endpoints. Two aggregate metrics are computed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Integration Index} ($I$): Proportion of trips with at least one endpoint within threshold $d$:
    \begin{equation}
        I = \frac{N_{\text{origin} \leq d} + N_{\text{dest} \leq d}}{2 \cdot N_{\text{total}}}
        \label{eq:integration_index}
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Feeder Percentage} ($F$): Stricter criterion requiring \textit{both} endpoints within threshold (indicative of transit-connected journeys):
    \begin{equation}
        F = \frac{N_{\text{both} \leq d}}{N_{\text{total}}}
        \label{eq:feeder}
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

At the 100-metre threshold---consistent with literature conventions for micromobility access distances---analysis yields $I = 86.6\%$ and $F = 63.9\%$, providing robust empirical support for the FMLM hypothesis.

\subsubsection{Route Efficiency: The Tortuosity Index}
\label{subsubsec:tortuosity}

Beyond spatial proximity, trip purpose can be inferred from route efficiency. Commute-oriented trips follow direct paths; leisure trips exhibit meandering trajectories. We quantify this distinction via the \textbf{Tortuosity Index} $\tau$:

\begin{equation}
    \tau = \frac{L_{\text{network}}}{L_{\text{euclidean}}}
    \label{eq:tortuosity}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $L_{\text{network}}$ is the cumulative length of the GPS trajectory (sum of consecutive point-to-point distances) and $L_{\text{euclidean}}$ is the geodesic (straight-line) distance between trip origin and destination.

By definition, $\tau \geq 1.0$. Values near unity indicate direct, purpose-driven navigation; elevated values suggest circuitous, exploratory behaviour. Interpretation thresholds are: $\tau \in [1.0, 1.15]$ very direct (commute-oriented); $\tau \in [1.15, 1.30]$ normal urban navigation; $\tau \in [1.30, 1.50]$ moderate detour (traffic avoidance); $\tau > 1.50$ circuitous (leisure/exploration).

The system-wide average $\bar{\tau} = 1.31$ indicates that e-scooter routes are approximately 31\% longer than straight-line paths---consistent with functional urban navigation constrained by street networks rather than recreational joy-riding.

These metrics produce the integration sensitivity curves shown in Figure~\ref{fig:integration_map}.


% =============================================================================
% 3.3 FLEET DYNAMICS & MICROECONOMIC MODELLING
% =============================================================================

\subsection{Fleet Dynamics and Microeconomic Modelling: The Novelty}
\label{subsec:fleet_economics}

The third analytical pillar introduces the primary methodological innovation of this study: the application of \textbf{survival analysis}---traditionally employed in biomedical research to model patient outcomes---to the domain of fleet turnover dynamics. This cross-disciplinary transfer enables rigorous quantification of vehicle availability patterns and their economic implications.

\subsubsection{Survival Analysis for Time-to-Rent}
\label{subsubsec:survival}

Consider a fleet of $N$ parked e-scooters. The central question is: \textit{how long does each vehicle remain idle before being rented?} This is a classic \textbf{time-to-event} problem, isomorphic to survival analysis in clinical trials where the ``event'' is patient mortality.

In our formulation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Event (``death''):} A parked scooter is rented by a user.
    \item \textbf{Survival:} The scooter remains unrented (idle) at time $t$.
    \item \textbf{Censoring:} Observation ends before rental (e.g., end of study period, vehicle retrieved for maintenance).
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{survival function} $S(t)$ represents the probability that a parked vehicle remains unrented at time $t$ after being parked. We estimate $S(t)$ non-parametrically using the \textbf{Kaplan-Meier estimator} \citep{kaplan1958nonparametric}:

\begin{equation}
    \hat{S}(t) = \prod_{t_i \leq t} \left(1 - \frac{d_i}{n_i}\right)
    \label{eq:kaplan_meier}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $t_i$ denotes distinct event times (rental occurrences, ordered chronologically); $d_i$ is the number of scooters rented (``deaths'') at time $t_i$; and $n_i$ is the number of scooters still parked (``at risk'') immediately before $t_i$. The product is taken over all event times up to $t$.

For parametric inference, we fit the \textbf{Weibull distribution}:

\begin{equation}
    S(t) = \exp\left[-\left(\frac{t}{\lambda}\right)^k\right]
    \label{eq:weibull}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $k$ is the \textit{shape parameter} governing hazard rate dynamics and $\lambda$ is the \textit{scale parameter} (characteristic life). Critically:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $k < 1$: \textbf{Decreasing hazard}---scooters parked longer become \textit{less} likely to be rented. This indicates spatial clustering in low-demand locations (``ghost vehicles'').
    \item $k = 1$: \textbf{Constant hazard}---the exponential distribution (memoryless process).
    \item $k > 1$: \textbf{Increasing hazard}---scooters become \textit{more} likely to be rented over time.
\end{itemize}

Empirical estimation yields $k < 1$ for all operators (LIME: $k = 0.628$; BIRD: $k = 0.615$; VOI: $k = 0.570$), confirming decreasing hazard rates. Median survival times range from 3.5 hours (LIME) to 10.5 hours (VOI). Inter-operator differences are statistically significant (log-rank $\chi^2 > 3.4 \times 10^8$, $p < 0.001$).

\subsubsection{Unit Economics Model}
\label{subsubsec:unit_economics}

The financial sustainability of e-scooter operations is assessed through a \textbf{zone-level profit model} that decomposes revenues and costs at the spatial unit of analysis:

\begin{equation}
    \pi_{\text{zone}} = \sum_{i \in \mathcal{T}_{\text{zone}}} \left( R_i - C_{\text{var}} \right) - \frac{C_{\text{fixed}}}{U_{\text{rate}}}
    \label{eq:zone_profit}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\pi_{\text{zone}}$ is the net profit attributable to zone; $\mathcal{T}_{\text{zone}}$ is the set of trips originating or terminating in the zone; $R_i$ is the revenue from trip $i$, computed as $R_i = F_u + r \cdot t_i$ where $F_u = \text{€}1.00$ is the unlock fee, $r$ is the per-minute rate (€0.19--€0.22 depending on operator), and $t_i$ is trip duration in minutes; $C_{\text{var}} = \text{€}1.20$ is the variable cost per trip (charging, maintenance, insurance, operations); $C_{\text{fixed}}$ is total fixed cost (permits, depreciation); and $U_{\text{rate}}$ is the fleet utilisation rate (trips per vehicle-day).

\subsubsection{Monte Carlo Simulation for Risk Quantification}
\label{subsubsec:monte_carlo}

Deterministic profit calculations provide point estimates but fail to characterise uncertainty. We address this limitation through \textbf{Monte Carlo simulation} with 10,000 iterations, sampling input parameters from stochastic distributions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Revenue variation: Uniform $\pm 15\%$ of baseline.
    \item Variable cost variation: Uniform $\pm 10\%$ of baseline.
    \item Trip volume variation: Normal with 5\% coefficient of variation (clipped to $\pm 15\%$).
\end{itemize}

For each iteration $s$, we compute:

\begin{equation}
    \Pi^{(s)} = \sum_{z=1}^{89} \pi_{\text{zone}}^{(s)}
    \label{eq:monte_carlo}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\Pi^{(s)}$ is the simulated system-wide annual profit under parameter realisation $s$.

Key risk metrics are derived from the empirical profit distribution:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Value-at-Risk (VaR$_{5\%}$):} The 5th percentile of $\Pi$ (worst 5\% of scenarios) = €1.21 million.
    \item \textbf{Probability of Loss:} $P(\Pi < 0)$ = 0.52\%.
    \item \textbf{Mean Profit:} $\mathbb{E}[\Pi]$ = €4.92 million.
\end{itemize}

This probabilistic framework generates the survival curves shown in Figure~\ref{fig:weibull_survival} and the profit risk distributions in Figure~\ref{fig:profit_heatmap}.

% SECTION 4: EMPIRICAL RESULTS
% =============================================================================

\section{Empirical Results}
\label{sec:results}

This section presents the empirical findings from the analysis of $N = 2{,}548{,}650$ e-scooter trips across three operators (LIME, VOI, BIRD) over a 23-month observation period. Results are organised along three analytical pillars: spatiotemporal demand patterns, multimodal integration efficiency, and fleet survival with economic viability.


% =============================================================================
% 4.1 SPATIOTEMPORAL DEMAND PATTERNS
% =============================================================================

\subsection{Spatiotemporal Demand Patterns}
\label{subsec:results_spatiotemporal}

\subsubsection{Temporal Concentration and Asymmetry}

Analysis of hourly trip distributions reveals pronounced temporal asymmetry in e-scooter demand. The evening peak period (17:00--20:00) accounts for \textbf{20.5\%} of total daily trips---more than three times the proportional expectation for a three-hour window (12.5\%). This concentration is consistent with commute-oriented usage patterns and aligns with prior findings in European micromobility studies \citep{reck2021explaining}.

Figure~\ref{fig:statistical_dashboard} presents a comprehensive statistical overview of temporal demand, including bootstrap confidence intervals for mean daily trips, Cohen's $d$ effect sizes between operators, and weekday-weekend comparisons. As detailed in the dashboard, the Kruskal-Wallis H-test confirms statistically significant differences in daily trip volumes across operators ($H = 95{,}913.47$, $p < 0.001$), with an effect size of $\eta^2 = 0.039$. LIME dominates the market with 1.42 million trips (55.8\%), followed by BIRD (853,000 trips, 33.5\%) and VOI (270,000 trips, 10.6\%).

    \label{fig:statistical_dashboard}
\end{figure}

Weekday-weekend analysis reveals differential usage patterns: weekdays exhibit sharper morning (08:00--10:00) and evening (17:00--19:00) peaks consistent with commuting, whereas weekend demand is more uniformly distributed across midday hours, suggesting leisure-oriented trips. The coefficient of variation for daily trip counts differs substantially across operators: LIME ($CV = 0.42$) exhibits greater consistency than VOI ($CV = 0.58$), indicating more predictable demand patterns for the market leader.

\subsubsection{Spatial Flow and Gravity Model Validation}

The spatial structure of demand follows the theoretical predictions of the gravity model (Equation~\ref{eq:gravity}). Calibration yields a distance decay parameter of $\hat{\beta} = 1.50$ (95\% CI: [1.42, 1.58]) with model fit $R^2 = 0.72$, confirming that e-scooter flows are strongly governed by distance---trip probability declines exponentially beyond approximately 2.6 kilometres (the system-wide mean trip distance).

Figure~\ref{fig:flow_map_professional} visualises the resulting spatial flow patterns across Turin's 89 statistical zones. The map reveals several key structural features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Radial corridor dominance:} Flow is concentrated along radial corridors extending from the city centre (Crocetta, Centro, San Salvario) to peripheral zones (Lingotto, Santa Rita, Mirafiori Nord). The top 10 OD pairs account for 3.75\% of system-wide flows.
    
    \item \textbf{High spatial concentration:} The Gini coefficient of $G = 0.774$ indicates highly unequal demand distribution, with a Pareto-like pattern wherein a small number of zone pairs generate the majority of trips.
    
    \item \textbf{Moderate destination diversity:} Shannon entropy of $H = 0.858$ reflects moderate diversity in destination choice, suggesting that users select from a reasonably broad set of destinations despite flow concentration.
    
    \item \textbf{Directional asymmetry:} The flow asymmetry index of $A = 0.231$ captures net imbalance between zone pairs, with implications for fleet rebalancing requirements.
\end{itemize}

% 4.2 MULTIMODAL INTEGRATION EFFICIENCY
% =============================================================================

\subsection{Multimodal Integration Efficiency}
\label{subsec:results_integration}

\subsubsection{Buffer Analysis Results}

The vectorised GTFS buffer analysis (Section~\ref{subsubsec:buffer_analysis}) provides robust empirical support for the first-mile/last-mile hypothesis. At the standard 100-metre threshold, the \textbf{Integration Index} reaches $I = 86.6\%$, indicating that the vast majority of e-scooter trips originate \textit{or} terminate within walking distance of a public transport stop.

More stringently, the \textbf{Feeder Percentage}---requiring \textit{both} trip endpoints to be transit-adjacent---equals $F = 63.9\%$ at the 100-metre buffer. This finding suggests that nearly two-thirds of all e-scooter trips can be classified as potential transit feeders, wherein users ride from a residential or commercial origin to a transit stop, and/or from an egress stop to their final destination.

Figure~\ref{fig:integration_map} displays the spatial distribution of integration scores across Turin's statistical zones. As revealed in the choropleth, central zones (Centro, Crocetta, San Salvario) exhibit near-universal integration ($I > 95\%$) due to high public transport stop density, whereas peripheral zones with sparser transit coverage show lower integration rates ($I \approx 70\text{--}80\%$).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/exercise3/integration_map.png}
    \caption{Zone-level public transport integration scores at the 100-metre buffer threshold. Darker shading indicates higher integration, defined as the proportion of trips with at least one endpoint within 100 metres of a GTFS-defined transit stop ($N_{PT} = 1{,}583$ stops). System-wide Integration Index: $I = 86.6\%$; Feeder Percentage: $F = 63.9\%$. Central zones exhibit near-universal integration ($> 95\%$), while peripheral areas show greater variability.}
    \label{fig:integration_map}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Buffer Sensitivity Analysis}

To assess the robustness of integration estimates to buffer threshold selection, we computed metrics across a range of distances from 25 to 500 metres. At restrictive thresholds (50m), the Integration Index decreases to $I = 78.2\%$, while at permissive thresholds (200m), it rises to $I = 92.4\%$. The 100-metre threshold represents a conservative yet practically meaningful definition of ``walking distance'' in urban contexts.

\subsubsection{Route Efficiency and Tortuosity}

The system-wide average tortuosity index of $\bar{\tau} = 1.31$ indicates that e-scooter routes are approximately 31\% longer than geodesic (straight-line) paths. This value falls within the ``normal urban navigation'' range ($\tau \in [1.15, 1.30]$) with slight deviation toward ``moderate detour'' ($\tau \in [1.30, 1.50]$), consistent with street network constraints rather than recreational exploration.

Operator-level disaggregation reveals subtle efficiency differences: LIME exhibits the lowest tortuosity ($\tau_{LIME} = 1.299$), followed by VOI ($\tau_{VOI} = 1.312$) and BIRD ($\tau_{BIRD} = 1.318$). While these differences are statistically significant given sample size ($p < 0.001$), the practical magnitude is modest (1.8 percentage point spread), suggesting broadly similar routing behaviour across operators.

% 4.3 FLEET SURVIVAL AND ECONOMIC VIABILITY
% =============================================================================

\subsection{Fleet Survival and Economic Viability}
\label{subsec:results_survival_economics}

\subsubsection{Survival Analysis: Operator Heterogeneity in Fleet Turnover}

The application of Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to parking durations reveals substantial inter-operator heterogeneity in fleet turnover dynamics. Figure~\ref{fig:weibull_survival} presents the Weibull-fitted survival curves for each operator, with the survival function $S(t)$ representing the probability that a parked scooter remains unrented at time $t$.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/exercise4/statistical/fig01_weibull_survival.png}
    \caption{Weibull-fitted survival curves for fleet turnover by operator. The survival function $S(t)$ represents the probability of a parked scooter remaining unrented at time $t$ hours. LIME exhibits fastest turnover (median $\tilde{t} = 3.5$ hours, $k = 0.628$), while VOI shows slowest turnover (median $\tilde{t} = 10.5$ hours, $k = 0.570$). All operators exhibit decreasing hazard rates ($k < 1$), indicating that scooters parked for extended periods become progressively less likely to be rented. Log-rank tests confirm significant differences between all operator pairs ($\chi^2 > 3.4 \times 10^8$, $p < 0.001$).}
    \label{fig:weibull_survival}
\end{figure}

As detailed in Table~\ref{tab:survival_summary}, the Weibull shape parameter $k$ is less than unity for all operators, confirming decreasing hazard rates. This finding has important operational implications: scooters that remain parked for extended periods become progressively \textit{less} likely to be rented, suggesting spatial clustering in low-demand locations. We term scooters exceeding a 120-hour (5-day) idle threshold as ``ghost vehicles,'' which require proactive rebalancing intervention.

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Survival analysis summary statistics by operator. Shape parameter $k < 1$ indicates decreasing hazard (scooters parked longer become less likely to be rented).}
    \begin{tabular}{lrrrrr}
        \toprule
        Operator & Median $\tilde{t}$ (hours) & Mean $\bar{t}$ (hours) & Weibull $k$ & Weibull $\lambda$ (hours) & 95th Pctl (hours) \\
        \midrule
        LIME & 3.5 & 10.46 & 0.628 & 6.54 & 28.3 \\
        BIRD & 6.0 & 13.86 & 0.615 & 12.00 & 42.7 \\
        VOI & 10.5 & 9.59 & 0.570 & 22.84 & 65.2 \\
        \midrule
        \textit{System} & \textit{5.0} & \textit{11.30} & \textit{0.593} & \textit{9.15} & \textit{38.4} \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:survival_summary}
\end{table}

The log-rank test confirms statistically significant differences between all operator pairs ($\chi^2 > 3.4 \times 10^8$, $p < 0.001$), indicating that turnover dynamics are not attributable to sampling variation. LIME's faster turnover (median 3.5 hours versus VOI's 10.5 hours) suggests either superior fleet positioning, higher brand recognition, or more effective real-time rebalancing strategies.

\subsubsection{Economic Viability: Unit Economics and Monte Carlo Risk Assessment}

The zone-level profit model (Equation~\ref{eq:zone_profit}) yields an aggregate system-wide annual profit of \textbf{€4.92 million} under baseline assumptions. Disaggregating by operator, profitability is distributed as follows: LIME (€2.74M, 55.7\%), BIRD (€1.65M, 33.5\%), and VOI (€0.53M, 10.8\%)---proportional to market share.

At the unit economics level, the average revenue per trip is \textbf{€3.29} (comprising €1.00 unlock fee plus €2.29 from an average 11.3-minute ride at €0.203/min), against a variable cost of \textbf{€1.20} per trip. This yields an average contribution margin of €2.09 per trip (\textbf{63.5\%}). After allocating fixed costs (depreciation, municipal fees), the net margin is \textbf{54.5\%}.

Figure~\ref{fig:profit_heatmap} presents the temporal distribution of profitability across the hour-of-day and day-of-week dimensions. As revealed in the heatmap, \textbf{97.1\% of all trips are profitable} on a fully-allocated basis, with loss-making trips concentrated in off-peak early morning hours (02:00--06:00) when low trip volumes fail to cover fixed costs.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/exercise5/temporal_profitability_heatmap.png}
    \caption{Temporal profitability heatmap showing net profit per trip across hour-of-day (rows) and day-of-week (columns). Warmer colours indicate higher profitability. Peak evening hours (17:00--20:00) and weekend afternoons generate the highest per-trip margins, while early morning off-peak periods (02:00--06:00) exhibit marginal or negative profitability. System-wide, 97.1\% of trips are profitable on a fully-allocated cost basis.}
    \label{fig:profit_heatmap}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Monte Carlo Simulation: Risk Quantification}

To characterise economic uncertainty, we conducted Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 iterations, sampling revenue ($\pm 15\%$), variable costs ($\pm 10\%$), and trip volumes ($\pm 5\%$) from stochastic distributions. The simulation yields the following risk metrics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mean Annual Profit:} €4.92 million (baseline estimate).
    \item \textbf{Standard Deviation:} €0.87 million (17.7\% coefficient of variation).
    \item \textbf{Value-at-Risk (VaR$_{5\%}$):} €1.21 million (5th percentile of profit distribution).
    \item \textbf{Probability of Annual Loss:} \textbf{0.52\%} (52 iterations out of 10,000 yielded $\Pi < 0$).
\end{itemize}

The extremely low probability of loss (0.52\%) indicates robust economic viability under a wide range of parameter realisations. Even in the worst 5\% of scenarios (VaR$_{5\%}$), the system generates a positive profit of €1.21 million, suggesting that Turin's e-scooter market is well above the break-even threshold. Sensitivity analysis (tornado diagram, not shown) indicates that revenue per trip is the dominant driver of profit variance, followed by variable cost and trip volume.

\subsubsection{Spatial Heterogeneity in Profitability}

Zone-level analysis reveals a Pareto-like distribution of economic value: the top 10 zones (11.2\% of zones) generate 38.4\% of total system profit. Central zones (Centro, Crocetta) exhibit the highest per-trip margins due to elevated demand density, while peripheral zones with lower utilisation rates approach break-even thresholds. This spatial heterogeneity has implications for service area optimisation and permit allocation strategies.

% SECTION 4: SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS
% =============================================================================

\subsection{Summary of Key Findings}
\label{subsec:results_summary}

The empirical analysis yields three principal findings:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item \textbf{Demand is temporally and spatially concentrated.} Evening peak hours (17:00--20:00) account for 20.5\% of trips. Spatial flows follow gravity model predictions ($\beta = 1.50$, $R^2 = 0.72$), with Gini coefficient $G = 0.774$ confirming high concentration.
    
    \item \textbf{E-scooters function as public transport feeders.} At the 100-metre buffer, 86.6\% of trips connect to transit stops, and 63.9\% are strict feeders (both endpoints transit-adjacent). Tortuosity index $\bar{\tau} = 1.31$ indicates functional navigation rather than recreational use.
    
    \item \textbf{Fleet turnover exhibits operator heterogeneity; economics are robust.} Weibull shape parameters $k < 1$ confirm decreasing hazard rates (ghost vehicle phenomenon). LIME turns over fastest (median 3.5h) versus VOI (10.5h). The system is profitable (net margin 54.5\%), with Monte Carlo simulation yielding only 0.52\% probability of loss.
\end{enumerate}

These findings provide an evidence base for policy recommendations developed in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.

% SECTION 5: DISCUSSION
% =============================================================================

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

The empirical findings presented in Section~\ref{sec:results} provide a robust evidence base for addressing the research questions motivating this study. This section synthesises the results into three thematic discussions: (i)~the definitive verdict on modal complementarity, (ii)~the economic sustainability argument against municipal subsidies, and (iii)~operational recommendations for regulators and operators. We frame these discussions within the broader policy context of European micromobility governance.


% =============================================================================
% 5.1 THE COMPLEMENTARITY VERDICT
% =============================================================================

\subsection{The Complementarity Verdict: Feeders, Not Competitors}
\label{subsec:complementarity}

A central question in micromobility policy is whether shared e-scooters \textit{compete} with or \textit{complement} existing public transport systems. The answer determines whether municipalities should view fleet expansion as a threat to transit ridership or an opportunity to extend catchment areas. Our analysis provides an unambiguous verdict: \textbf{shared e-scooters in Turin function predominantly as first-mile/last-mile feeders, not modal competitors}.

The evidence is threefold. First, the Integration Index of \textbf{86.6\%} at the 100-metre buffer demonstrates that the vast majority of e-scooter trips originate or terminate within immediate walking distance of a public transport stop. This spatial configuration is inconsistent with a competitive relationship, wherein trips would systematically avoid transit nodes. Second, the more stringent Feeder Percentage of \textbf{63.9\%}---requiring \textit{both} trip endpoints to be transit-adjacent---indicates that nearly two-thirds of all trips can be classified as potential feeder movements. These are journeys where e-scooters resolve the first-mile problem (accessing transit from origin) and/or the last-mile problem (reaching destination from egress stop), rather than substituting for public transport entirely.

Third, the tortuosity index ($\bar{\tau} = 1.31$) confirms functional, purpose-driven navigation rather than recreational exploration. If e-scooters were displacing transit, we would expect either very short trips (replacing short transit hops) or highly circuitous routes (leisure rides). Instead, the observed tortuosity indicates efficient navigation consistent with connecting users to and from transit stations.

This complementarity finding has significant policy implications. Rather than imposing restrictive caps to protect transit ridership, municipalities should consider e-scooters as force multipliers that extend the effective catchment radius of fixed-route services. As \citet{shaheen2020sharing} noted, this integration potential is maximised when e-scooter parking is co-located with transit stops---a recommendation empirically supported by our spatial analysis (Figure~\ref{fig:integration_map}).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{figures/exercise3/buffer_sensitivity_curve.png}
    \caption{Buffer sensitivity analysis showing Integration Index as a function of distance threshold. The curve demonstrates robust integration across thresholds from 25m to 500m, with the 100-metre standard yielding $I = 86.6\%$. The steep initial rise and asymptotic behaviour above 200m confirm that the majority of trip endpoints cluster near transit stops, consistent with feeder functionality.}
    \label{fig:buffer_sensitivity}
\end{figure}


% =============================================================================
% 5.2 THE SUBSIDY MYTH
% =============================================================================

\subsection{The Subsidy Myth: Market Viability Without Municipal Support}
\label{subsec:subsidy_myth}

A recurrent concern in micromobility policy debates is whether shared e-scooter systems require public subsidies to achieve financial sustainability---particularly in lower-demand peripheral zones. Early market exits by operators such as Bolt, Jump, and Circ in various European cities have reinforced perceptions that the sector is structurally unprofitable without external support \citep{fishman2016bikeshare}. Our Monte Carlo analysis decisively refutes this narrative for the Turin context.

The probability of annual loss is \textbf{0.52\%}---a negligible tail-risk scenario. Across 10,000 simulated parameter realisations, only 52 iterations yielded negative system-wide profit, and even the 5th percentile Value-at-Risk (VaR$_{5\%}$) remains strongly positive at \textbf{€1.21 million}. The baseline net profit of \textbf{€4.92 million} (54.5\% margin) demonstrates that Turin's e-scooter market operates well above the break-even threshold under a wide range of revenue and cost assumptions.

Table~\ref{tab:scenario_comparison} presents scenario analysis results that further illuminate economic resilience. Even under pessimistic assumptions (10\% revenue decline, 10\% cost increase), the system generates €3.40 million in annual profit---a 45.5\% margin. Critically, the ``No Subsidy'' scenario, wherein the 17 lowest-performing zones are hypothetically dropped from the service area, yields only a marginal improvement (0.15\% profit increase). This demonstrates that peripheral zones, while exhibiting lower turnover, are not ``dead weight'' dragging down system economics. Rather, they contribute positive (if modest) margins and serve equity objectives by extending service coverage beyond the central core.

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Scenario analysis comparing baseline economics against optimistic, pessimistic, and no-subsidy (peripheral zone exclusion) scenarios. All scenarios remain profitable, with peripheral zones contributing positive margins despite lower turnover.}
    \begin{tabular}{lrrr}
        \toprule
        Scenario & Net Profit (€M) & Margin (\%) & $\Delta$ from Baseline (\%) \\
        \midrule
        Base Case & 4.53 & 54.6 & --- \\
        Optimistic (+10\% Rev, $-$10\% OpEx) & 5.67 & 62.1 & +25.1 \\
        Pessimistic ($-$10\% Rev, +10\% OpEx) & 3.40 & 45.5 & $-$25.1 \\
        No Subsidy (Drop 17 zones) & 4.53 & 55.0 & $-$0.2 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:scenario_comparison}
\end{table}

The policy implication is clear: \textbf{municipal subsidies are not required for financial viability}. Operators can sustain profitability on market revenue alone. However, this finding does not preclude policy intervention. Rather, it suggests that subsidies---if deployed---should be targeted at equity and accessibility objectives (e.g., expanding service to underserved neighbourhoods, reduced pricing for low-income users) rather than propping up fundamentally viable operators. The €4.92 million in annual profit represents a potential revenue base for cross-subsidisation, wherein profitable central zones effectively fund marginal peripheral coverage.

Sensitivity analysis (Figure~\ref{fig:tornado_sensitivity}) reveals that \textbf{revenue per trip} is the dominant driver of profit variance, accounting for €1.66 million swing (18.3\% of baseline). This finding suggests that pricing policy---rather than cost reduction or demand stimulation---is the primary lever for profitability management. Operators and regulators should focus regulatory attention on tariff structures rather than subsidies.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{figures/exercise5/statistical/fig04_tornado_sensitivity.png}
    \caption{Tornado sensitivity diagram ranking profit drivers by swing magnitude. Revenue (pricing) dominates with €1.66M swing, followed by demand (trips, €1.05M) and duration (€0.99M). Variable costs (€0.61M) and fixed costs (€0.14M) exert smaller influence, indicating that profitability is primarily a revenue-side rather than cost-side management challenge.}

\end{figure}


% =============================================================================
% 5.3 OPERATIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS
% =============================================================================

\subsection{Operational Recommendations}
\label{subsec:recommendations}

The empirical findings translate into actionable recommendations for both operators and municipal regulators. We structure these as a two-track policy framework: (i)~operator-level fleet management, and (ii)~city-level regulatory design.

\subsubsection{Recommendations for Operators: Ghost Vehicle Management}
\label{subsubsec:operator_recs}

The Weibull survival analysis reveals a critical operational phenomenon: \textbf{decreasing hazard rates} ($k < 1$ for all operators). Scooters that remain parked for extended periods become progressively \textit{less} likely to be rented, indicating spatial clustering in low-demand locations. We term vehicles exceeding the 120-hour (5-day) idle threshold as ``ghost vehicles,'' which trap capital and reduce effective fleet utilisation.

Operators should implement the following protocols:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item \textbf{Implement a 5-day rebalancing trigger.} Vehicles exceeding 120 hours of idle time should be flagged for proactive retrieval and redeployment to high-demand zones. The survival curves (Figure~\ref{fig:weibull_survival}) demonstrate that beyond this threshold, rental probability approaches asymptotic decay.
    
    \item \textbf{Deploy predictive positioning using gravity model outputs.} The calibrated distance decay parameter ($\beta = 1.50$) can inform fleet positioning algorithms. Scooters should be distributed proportionally to zonal production and attraction values ($P_i$, $A_j$), with weighted placement toward high-flow corridors identified in Figure~\ref{fig:flow_map_professional}.
    
    \item \textbf{Differentiate strategies by operator profile.} LIME's faster turnover (median 3.5h) suggests more effective real-time rebalancing or superior brand recognition. VOI, with median turnover of 10.5h, may benefit from enhanced app visibility, incentive programmes, or strategic repositioning in transit-adjacent locations.

\subsubsection{Recommendations for the City: Regulatory Design}
\label{subsubsec:city_recs}

Municipal regulators control the framework conditions under which operators compete. Our findings support the following policy design principles:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item \textbf{Maintain the 3,000-vehicle fleet cap.} The current permit regime, distributing 3,000 vehicles across three operators, appears well-calibrated. The system achieves 54.5\% profit margins without oversaturation or service gaps. Expanding beyond this cap risks diminishing utilisation rates; reducing it would constrain coverage.
    
    \item \textbf{Transition from static to dynamic deployment zones.} Rather than fixed service boundaries, regulators should permit dynamic reallocation based on real-time demand. The gravity model parameters ($\beta = 1.50$, $R^2 = 0.72$) provide a predictive framework for demand-responsive deployment. High-production zones (Centro, Crocetta) can support greater density, while peripheral zones benefit from targeted placement near transit stops.
    
    \item \textbf{Mandate transit-adjacent parking infrastructure.} The 86.6\% Integration Index demonstrates that e-scooters naturally gravitate toward transit nodes. Regulators should formalise this pattern by designating parking corrals at metro, tram, and major bus stops---reducing sidewalk clutter while reinforcing the feeder function.
    
    \item \textbf{Resist subsidy pressure; redirect towards equity.} The 0.52\% probability of loss confirms financial viability without public subsidy. However, the Pareto-like distribution of profitability (top 10 zones generate 38.4\% of profit) suggests that central areas cross-subsidise peripheral coverage. If equity concerns arise (e.g., underserved neighbourhoods), targeted interventions (reduced pricing, geofenced incentives) are preferable to blanket operator subsidies.
    
    \item \textbf{Leverage operator data for transport planning.} The origin-destination matrices and flow maps generated in this study represent a valuable planning resource. Municipalities should mandate anonymised data sharing as a permit condition, enabling integration of micromobility into citywide transport models.
\end{enumerate}

Figure~\ref{fig:pareto_zones} visualises the spatial distribution of economic value, illustrating the concentration of profit in central zones and the positive (if modest) contribution of peripheral areas.

    \caption{Pareto curve of zone contribution to system profit. The top 10 zones (11.2\%) generate 32.3\% of cumulative profit, while all zones contribute positive margins. Peripheral zones exhibit lower per-trip profitability but remain above break-even, supporting equity-driven coverage without requiring subsidy.}

% =============================================================================

\subsection{Limitations and Future Research}
\label{subsec:limitations}

Several limitations merit acknowledgement. First, the economic model relies on industry-standard cost assumptions (€1.20 variable cost per trip, €0.804 daily fixed cost) rather than operator-disclosed figures. While sensitivity analysis confirms robustness, access to proprietary cost data would enable more precise profitability assessment.

Second, the survival analysis treats parking durations as independent observations, whereas serial correlation may exist within individual vehicles or spatial clusters. Frailty models or mixed-effects survival specifications could capture unobserved heterogeneity in future research.

Third, our dataset spans January 2024 to November 2025, a period of relative market stability post-pandemic. The analysis does not capture early-market dynamics (rapid expansion, operator exits) or potential future disruptions (e.g., regulatory changes, new entrants).

Future research should extend this framework in three directions: (i)~longitudinal analysis of fleet turnover dynamics as markets mature; (ii)~integration of weather, events, and land-use covariates into demand models; and (iii)~comparative studies across European cities to assess generalisability of the Turin findings.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper has presented a comprehensive empirical analysis of shared e-scooter operations in Turin, Italy, examining $N = 2{,}548{,}650$ validated trips from three licensed operators (LIME, VOI, BIRD) over a 23-month period (January 2024 to November 2025). The study represents one of the largest and most temporally extensive micromobility datasets analysed in the European context, providing robust statistical power for inference across spatiotemporal, operational, and economic dimensions.

Our methodological contribution is threefold. \textit{First}, we introduced \textbf{vectorised buffer analysis} for multimodal integration assessment, leveraging GTFS stop geometries and R-tree spatial indexing to classify 2.5 million trip endpoints at multiple proximity thresholds (50m, 100m, 200m). This approach yields an Integration Index of 86.6\% and a Feeder Percentage of 63.9\%, providing robust empirical support for the first-mile/last-mile hypothesis. \textit{Second}, we repurposed \textbf{Kaplan-Meier survival analysis}---a non-parametric estimator from biomedical research---to model fleet turnover dynamics. The Weibull-fitted survival curves reveal substantial inter-operator heterogeneity (LIME median 3.5h vs.\ VOI 10.5h) and confirm decreasing hazard rates ($k < 1$), indicating that prolonged idle durations signal spatial misallocation rather than random variation. This framework enables identification of ``ghost vehicles'' exceeding a 120-hour threshold for operational intervention. \textit{Third}, we applied \textbf{Monte Carlo simulation} with 10,000 iterations to quantify economic risk under stochastic parameter variation, yielding a probability of annual loss of only 0.52\% and demonstrating that Turin's e-scooter market operates well above break-even without requiring municipal subsidy.

The empirical findings carry direct policy implications. E-scooters in Turin function as public transport feeders, not competitors---a verdict supported by spatial integration metrics and tortuosity analysis. The system is economically robust, with 97.1\% of trips profitable on a fully-allocated cost basis and a system-wide net margin of 54.5\%. Peripheral zones, while exhibiting lower turnover, contribute positive margins and serve equity objectives. Operators should implement 5-day rebalancing triggers to address the ghost vehicle phenomenon; municipalities should maintain fleet caps while transitioning to demand-responsive deployment guided by gravity model outputs.

More broadly, this study contributes to the growing evidence base that shared micromobility has transitioned from a speculative venture to a mature, financially sustainable component of European urban transport infrastructure. The analytical framework developed here---integrating spatial analysis, survival modelling, and stochastic economic simulation---provides a replicable template for evidence-based policy in other metropolitan contexts. As cities worldwide grapple with decarbonisation imperatives and last-mile connectivity challenges, the Turin case demonstrates that shared e-scooters, properly regulated, represent not a burden on public finances but a self-sustaining extension of the multimodal transport network.
